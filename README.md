🎬 Movies Industry Dataset — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## **Overview**

This project focuses on performing an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a movies industry dataset. The goal is to understand trends in budgets, revenues, genres, release years, and overall movie performance.
It highlights a complete analytical workflow from raw data to insights.

---

## **Objectives**

* Clean and preprocess the dataset.
* Identify trends in movie production over time.
* Analyse financial performance (budget, revenue, profit).
* Compare genres and their commercial outcomes.
* Visualize key patterns to support data-driven conclusions.

---

## **Tech Stack**

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## **Workflow Summary**

### 1. Data Understanding

* Loaded dataset
* Checked shape, data types, missing values, duplicates
* Initial descriptive statistics

### 2. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Removed duplicates
* Standardised types (numeric, date, categorical)

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

* Year-wise production trends
* Genre-wise financial performance
* Budget vs Revenue comparisons
* Profitability patterns
* Outlier detection

### 4. Visualisations

Created clear charts for:

* Budget vs Revenue scatterplots
* Distribution plots of budget, revenue, profit
* Genre comparison bar charts
* Year-wise line trends

---

## **Key Insights**

(You can edit these based on notebook results)

* Budgets and revenues show an upward trend over the years.
* Genres like Action/Adventure tend to have higher returns.
* There is a positive relationship between budget and revenue, with notable outliers.
* Profitability varies widely: only a fraction of movies deliver high returns.
* Some years show spikes in both production and revenue.
